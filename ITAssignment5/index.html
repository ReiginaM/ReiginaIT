        <h1 class="title">Hello, I'm <span>Reigina Mae Martin</span></h1>
        <p>I'm currently a first-year Computer Science student at John Abbott College in Montreal. I'm enjoying the program so far. I'm having a 
        great time learning concepts and applying them.
        In my free time, I like to play video games with my friends, watch anime and read manga. I love to eat sushi, poutine and pho. Mango is the superior fruit. 
        I was born in Manila, Philippines then moved to Canada when I was 4 years old. It's quite nice to converse in 3 languages: English, French and Tagalog.
        </p>
        <p>I'm currently still a novice at programming but I'm enjoying learning it. The different problems
            we're introduced are fun to solve. I still don't exactly know the path I'll take within Computer Science. However, learning
            about Cybersecurity made me interested in possibly getting a job in that field.
